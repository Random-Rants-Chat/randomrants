## Notices and warnings:

* Based on [Gvbvdxx Chat](https://jasonglenevans.github.io/GvbvdxxChat/)'s source code - May lack of security in some parts of the site. The source code for this site is not the greatest in security. Security and reliablity are not balanced completley yet.
* Uses WebRTC servers that may possibly not work - If a certian WebRTC server is blocked or broken, screen sharing and camera sharing may become really unstable.
* No moderation - The website does not have IP banning or any way to ban or block someone, this means that everyone can be mistreated. Their is a ``;kick someone`` command, but it requires the special password to use it. (Hint: its in chat.js)
* No compilers - This website is made without compilers in mind, meaning you can view the source code of this website through the website itself. Though that some parts do use a compiler, the website provides pre-compiled resources!
* Uses ``window.name = something;`` - Simply using the ``;execute (username) (code)`` command can mess with parts of the website, making commands like ``;kick someone`` easy to disable for a user.
